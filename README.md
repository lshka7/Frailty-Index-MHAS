## Generate Frailty Index in MHAS

This repository hosts the processes and codes for generating a Frailty Index in the Mexican Health and Ageing study (MHAS).

We use the accumulation of deficits approach, validated in MHAS by [Garcia-Gonzales, 2009](https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2318-9-47).

Garcia-Gonzales's validation was based on the approach described by [Searle et al, 2008. A standard procedure for creating a frailty index](https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2318-8-24#citeas)
